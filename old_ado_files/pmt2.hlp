Time-series operators are allowed. {pstd}Weights are not allowed. Instead the routine uses survey settings (see {cmd:svyset}) to apply weights and correct for cluster correlations. {marker options}{...}{synoptset 27 tabbed}{...}{synopthdr:options}{synoptline}{syntab:Required Options}{synopt:{opt poor}} this is binary (dummy) variable that indicates who in the population is actually poor {p_end}{synopt:{opt cutoffs}} (numlist of integers) the measures of performance (coverage, undercoverage, leakage) depend on the cutoffs (threshold levels) of consumption used for determining eligibility. cutoffs is a numlist of percentiles of predicted consumption to be used as cutoffs for determining eligibility. Only those with predicted consumption below the cutoff are eligible. Performance measures are calculated for each cutoff specified {it:filename}{p_end}{synopt:{opt quantiles}} (integer) this number specified the number of quantiles (e.g. 5 for quintiles, 4 for quartiles, etc.) for classifying actual consumption (as opposed to predicted consumption). This is used for calculating performance measures by quantile of actual consumption {p_end}{syntab:Optional Options}{synopt:{opt graphme}} (integer) specifies for which cutoff threshold (expressed as a percentile of predicted consumption) to graph the results for. If this value does not match any of the values specified in the numlist specified by cutoffs, then no graph will be produced {p_end}{synopt:{opt logpline}} (real number) this is for graphing the results. If specified, the graph will include a vertical line meeting the point on the x-axis corresponding to the value specified. It is intended to show the boundary between the actual poor and non-poor {p_end}{synopt:{opt usesubsetbetas}} (binary variable) this option allows using the betas estimated from using a sub sample to preduct consumption for the entire sample. It is useful if, for example, you want use the betas estimated by running the model on the part of the population with the lowest 20, 30, or 50% of consumption, then you would generate a binary (dummy) variable indicating who is the this group (e.g. gen poorest_30percent = ...), and include specifiy it using this option (i.e. u(poorest_30percent) or usesubsamplebetas(poorest_30percent) ) {p_end}{* DESCRIPTION *}{title:Description}{pstd}{cmd:pmt} calculates PMT performance measures for the model specified by the arguments to the command. The performance measures includeleakage, undercoverage and coverage rates (overall and by quantile). Regression statistics such as number of observations, R2, and the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficientare also reported. {pstd}'leakage' is the ratio of the number of people that are eligible and non-poor to the total number of eligible people'undercoverage' is the ration of the number of people that are poor an ineligible to the total number of poor people. 'coverage' is the fraction of the total people, poor and non-poor, that are covered by the program.{title:Saved Results}{pstd}{cmd:pmt} saves the following in {cmd:r()}:{synoptset 15 tabbed}{...}{p2col 5 15 19 2: Scalars}{p_end}{synopt:{cmd:r(N)}}number of observations{p_end}{synopt:{cmd:r(r2)}}R^2 of the regression model (from the {cmd:reg} command){p_end}{synopt:{cmd:r(rho)}}Spearman rank correlation coefficient (from the {cmd:spearman} command) {p_end}{synopt:{cmd:r(leakage_X)}}leakage rate for cuttoff of Xth percentile{p_end}{synopt:{cmd:r(undercoverage_X)}}undercoverage rate for cuttoff of Xth percentile{p_end}{synopt:{cmd:r(coverage_cutoff`x'_quantile`q')}}gives the coverage rate of quantile q (where q=1,2,etc up until the number of quantiles specified) for cutoff of Xth percentile{p_end}{p2colreset}{...}{title:Author}{phang}Shafique Jamal, sjamal@worldbank.org{title:Acknowledgement}{pstd}{title:Also see}{psee}Online: {help regress}{p_end}
